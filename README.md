# Xamarin.Forms.Behaviors

This project is just a collection of useful behaviors for Xamarin.Forms.

At the moment, the collection just has the EventToCommandBehavior which is very self explanatory. In this implementation you can also pass the EventArgs object as the CommandParameter which can become very handy.

If you have any other suggestions or you just want to collaborate with this project you'll be very welcome.

Enjoy!
